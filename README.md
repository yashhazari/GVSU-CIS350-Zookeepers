# Zookeepers

Our project creates an interface that is designed for people who work in zoos.  This interface can be used to allow them to explain to visitors various information and facts about the different species in the zoo.  The user selects a species from a drop down menu.  The species information then takes over the screen displaying their population size, types food, area of origin, and other information.  There will also be a search bar to allow the user to type the species instead of looking through the list.  Last, there will be the ability to favorite species that the user feels they reference often.  The favorites will be at the top in the drop down menu.

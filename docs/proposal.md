Team name: Zookeepers

Team members: Yash Hazari and Lucian Whitaker

# Introduction

Our project is primarily for people who work in zoos (zookeepers), but will have a large impact beyond just them. This interface will allow zookeepers to have immense details and facts available about many different species without having to memorize it all.  This would allow for a better experience for visitors.  They would be able to learn more and zookeepers would be more prepared for questions they may get asked.  To add, this would make for a better reputation of the zoos that utilize this service because they have more knowledge.  Thus more business would be brought in, and the zoo would prosper which is good for investors.

This project creates the interface and backend for this application.  Thus, when you run the project code you should be able to have a window open with the full capabilities and functionality described.  This includes being able to see the search bar to search available animals.  To add, there will also be a drop down menu to select an animal/species.  Our last defining feature of this application will be the ability to favorite certain animals/species.  The nice thing about animals that the user favorites is that those animals will appear at the top of the drop down menu (before those that are not favorited).

Overall, this project allows for a larger amount of knowledge to be more readily available at the fingertips of those who work in zoos.  This application will impact many people making for a more insightful and better experience at the zoos that choose to use it.  It holds a great benefit to users of this application because they won't have to memorze so many scrutinous details and facts.  Instead, they will just have an easy way to access it at anytime they need it.  In summary, this application has a large impact with a lot of benefits to many different people and would make for an excellent project.

Key Features:

- Search bar
- Favortie animals button
- Drop down menu/list (with favorited animals at the top)

# Anticipated Technologies

- Python Interpreter
- PyCharm Edu
- tkinter Library

# Method/Approach

Our project will follow a form of the V-model to test as much as possible allowing for easy debugging.  We will as a team design the software and requirements.  We will be scrutinous with this as it dictates how we develop our code and tests.  We will then separate to develop the code (Yash) and the test code (Lucian).  These will happen at the same time which isn't exactly how the V-model describes, but is what works best for our timeline.  Because these are still happening separately, it still follows the logic of the V-model.  Upon completion of this we will then begin testing.  Lucian will lead this as he wrote the test code, but Yash will also help run these tests to help fix and debug since he wrote the code and thus knows it a bit better.  After testing is complete we leave a few extra days just in case something takes longer than expected.  These extra days will also allow us to be sure everything in the repository and documentation looks nice and is ready to be handed off.

# Estimated Timeline

7. 12/2/2024: User-Acceptance Testing Complete
8. 12/6/2024: Project Fully Complete (Including Documentation and Refinements)

# Anticipated Problems

- Testing is tightly packed because of large amount of time coding, may be too tightly packed, but if code is done early we can move into testing earlier
- May need more functions than anticipated which would increase unit testing time
- Haven't used tkinter in PyCharm before, but have planned to use VS Code if needed

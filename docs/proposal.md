Team name: Zookeepers

Team members: Yash Hazari and Lucian Whitaker

# Introduction

Our project is primarily for people who work in zoos (zookeepers), but will have a large impact beyond just them.  
(Also define some loosely defined features of your project using bullet points)

# Anticipated Technologies

- Python Interpreter
- PyCharm Edu
- tkinter Library

# Method/Approach

Our project will follow a form of the V-model to test as much as possible allowing for easy debugging.  We will as a team design the software and requirements.  We will be scrutinous with this as it dictates how we develop our code and tests.  We will then separate to develop the code (Yash) and the test code (Lucian).  These will happen at the same time which isn't exactly how the V-model describes, but is what works best for our timeline.  Because these are still happening separately, it still follows the logic of the V-model.  Upon completion of this we will then begin testing.  Lucian will lead this as he wrote the test code, but Yash will also help run these tests to help fix and debug since he wrote the code and thus knows it a bit better.  After testing is complete we leave a few extra days just in case something takes longer than expected.  These extra days will also allow us to be sure everything in the repository and documentation looks nice and is ready to be handed off.

# Estimated Timeline

10/7/2024: Software and Module Design Complete
11/4/2024: Project Code and Test Code Complete
11/9/2024: Unit Testing Complete
11/18/2024: Integration Testing Complete
11/24/2024: System Testing Complete
12/2/2024: User-Acceptance Testing Complete
12/6/2024: Project Fully Complete (Including Documentation and Refinements)

# Anticipated Problems

- Testing is tightly packed because of large amount of time coding, may be too tightly packed, but if code is done early we can move into testing earlier
- May need more functions than anticipated which would increase unit testing time
- Haven't used tkinter in PyCharm before, but have planned to use VS Code if needed

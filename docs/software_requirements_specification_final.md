# Overview

The purpose of a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) skeleton document is to provide a structured framework for defining and organizing the key elements of a software project. It helps guide the detailed documentation of the systemâ€™s functional and non-functional requirements. Also, it sorts the requirements based on the features they are relevant to. This helps when developing and testing your code. You are able to look at whatever feature you are working on and see the exact requirements relevent to your work that you need to meet. Another added benefit is that it documents all of your requirements and features in one easy access spot. Overall, this document serves as a guide to what features the project has and the requirements related to each of those features.
